[bug report](#bug-bug-report) and let us know!

If you have a question about the project, feel free to ask via [here the communication channel of your choice]().


## How to contribute

There many ways you can contribute to this project!

- **Enhancement** :sparkles: : Feature is working correctly but it can be improved.
- **Feature Request** :rocket: : New functionality is needed.  

> #### :eyes: After Submitting Your Contribution
> You must be aware of comments and status resolution (Agreed, Postponed or Rejected) see [The issue life-cycle](#the-issue-life-cycle).

## Creating an issue

### Bug Report :bug:

Every software has bugs. We can't fix what we don't know about, so please report freely. If you're not sure whether something is a bug or not, feel free to file it anyway.

Before reporting a bug, please search existing issues and pull requests, as it's possible that someone else has already reported your error. In case you find your issue as fixed/closed, please add a reference to it on your new one.

Your issue should contain a title and a clear description. You should also include as much relevant information as possible and a code sample that demonstrates the problem. The goal of a bug report is to make it easy for yourself - and others - to replicate the bug and fix it.

Opening an issue is easy filling out [this](https://github.com/melisource/fury_new-app-01/issues/new?labels=bug&template=bug-template.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+%3Ctitle%3E) template.

### Feature Request/Enhancement :rocket:

Generally speaking a RFC is needed when you want to add a new component or change an existing one in an incompatible way that might result in a major version bump.

Though it seems a little bureaucratic, this process helps to avoid the frustration of a potential contributor by generating discussions before any code is written. Once the design and direction are fully agreed then the contributor can work peacefully knowing that changes will be committed.

As of this moment all you need to do is create an issue and use the
[Feature Request Template](https://github.com/melisource/fury_new-app-01/issues/new?labels=enhancement&template=feature-request-template.md&title=%5BFEATURE%5D+%3Ctitle%3E).

Please prepend your issue title with `[RFC]` so that's easier to filter.

## Coding Guidance

All contributors *MUST* follow the [Coding Guidelines](CODING_GUIDELINES.md). Contributions that do not follow these guidelines will not be taken into account until the necessary modifications are made.


## The issue life-cycle

- **Proposed:** Every issue starts with this status. The issue has fifteen days to be discussed by the team and moved to the next status.

- **Agreed:** This status means that we agree with your proposal. We will assign a reviewer to the issue.

- **Active:** Issues with this status are being developed.

- **Implemented:** The issue has its PR under review, approved or waiting to be deployed.

- **Postponed:** We agree with the proposal, but its development won't take place in a short-term future.

- **Rejected:** Low quality proposals, proposals that were previously-rejected or those that don't fit into a long-term roadmap might be quickly rejected.

## Pull Request

If you are contributing with code, then you must:

- Make sure that there is an issue for the bug or feature you are implementing.
- Create a fork of this repository to make your changes.
- Read and follow our [coding guidelines](CODING_GUIDELINES.md).
- Make meaningful commits so that we can follow your work.
- Include unit tests, and if applicable, integration tests as well.
- Once you finish your work, create a pull request linking the original issue.
- Add a clear title and a description explaining the solution.
- Notify the maintainers of the new PR.

>If the development of the solution is taking too much time, **always** [rebase](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase) towards `master/develop`
>before asking for a review, and avoid reverse merge commits (they make git history tree a mess).

## SLA

- **Bug Fixes** :bug: : Are checked within 3 week days.
- **Enhancements** :sparkles:: Are checked within 2 weeks.
- **Features** :rocket:: Are checked within 2 weeks.

> What do we mean when we say that an issue was checked?
> That the reviewer either agreed or rejected your proposal

## Trusted Committers
Trusted Committers (TCs) are those members of our working group who have elevated rights and direct write access to this repository.

> Trusted Committers act as stewards of the working group and community. They aim to make consensus-based decisions in the best interest of the working group.
They also act as the guardians of this repository: TCs react to, referee, and give feedback about incoming contributions.
