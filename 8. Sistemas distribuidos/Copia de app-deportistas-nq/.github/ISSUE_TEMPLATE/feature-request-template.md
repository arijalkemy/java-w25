## **NEW!** Feature 🚀

### Name 📎

  <!-- We do not expect a cool name (though it can be 😉), but we need a reference to discuss it. -->

### Specifications ⚙️

* *Are you talking about an existing feature?*

  <!-- You might want to request an enhancement. Visual evidence (Videos, Gifs, Images) of the existing feature can help us better identify how to help you. -->

* *Describe the solution you'd like*

  <!-- Whether a brand new feature or an enhancement, you may want to create diagrams to better picture what you expect as a solution. [Here's](https://github.com/mercadolibre/fury_innersource-frontend-platform/issues/17) an example of how to do it. -->

* *Describe alternatives you've considered*

  <!-- Do not take for granted that your solution above is the only possibility. It might not be feasible. We will not speculate on another option for you, thus make sure to explore other viable ones. -->

* *Additional context*

  <!-- More important than describing what you expect from a feature is actually describing what you don't. -->
